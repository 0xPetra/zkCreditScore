[Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IL9NHXHovKATSQy93ikVbDJ8Iveg7Mez/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=116306611373279942057&rtpof=true&sd=true)

**DeFi sucks. We want to make it better by enabling uncollateralized lending.** We take people‚Äôs reputation, create ZK proofs, feed them into a ZKML model to generate a credit score. Then we give people microcredits based on their score.

## Short description

Yes, defi is great. You can get decentralized loans without having to go through any intermediary.

- **What? You can just go and get money?**
  
  Yes, you only have to connect your wallet and stake your collateral.

- **Collateral?**
  
  Yes, you stake some of your crypto to get a crypto loan. You stake 1000 USD in ETH and get something like 600 USD in stablecoins.

- **So I need to give them my money so they can give me less money?**
  
  Well, yes, it‚Äôs collateral. You need it to make the system safe.

- **But bro, if I already had crypto why would I need a crypto loan?**
  
  Well isn‚Äôt it obvious? For leverage, you can go like 10X and drive the wave bro, the bull market is gonna come soon LFGGGGGG.

"Yeah well, I forgot I had to do something, see you later bro."

**Defi promised a new financial system. But it currently sucks.** Lending is used mostly for leverage, creating exacerbated cycles of hype and pump and dump dynamics.

We want to fix it. And the best way of doing so is by enabling uncollateralized lending. People in countries like Argentina, Turkey, or Nigeria don‚Äôt have 1 ETH to stake as collateral. If we solve lending we can offer them real solutions and unlock a new wave of credit and economy growth. 

**How do we do it? It‚Äôs a 3 step process:**
1. We use the web3 reputation stack and transaction history, together with off-chain attestations to generate ZK proofs of people‚Äôs creditworthiness.
2. We feed everything to a ZKML model to create a private credit score.
3. Then, based on that score, we give people microcredits.

**Microcredits are low-value loans** focused on serving those people that have traditionally been left out of conservative banking systems. Though it might seem counterintuitive, microcredits have a much lower default rate than other models, especially in emerging economies, which is key to building an uncollateralized lending protocol.

**How it‚Äôs made:**
- **DOG** is a protocol that can easily integrate any piece of the reputation stack, make ZK proofs out of it, and use them to feed our credit score ZKML.
- **Axiom and World ID** to create reputational ZK proofs.
- **EZKL** to build a credit score.
- **Lendor smart contracts** on Base, Scroll, and Celo.
